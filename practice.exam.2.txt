This is a practice exam, to prepare yourself for the final exam. You can take this exam as many times as you like, the score will not count towards your final grade. To pass the exam you need a score of 70% (21 out of 30 questions correct).

In the real exam, please make sure your internet connection is good and don't forget to save your answers from time to time. You can take the final exam only once every 30 days, so make sure you are well prepared!

This practice final exam consists of 30 multiple-choice questions about the research described below. Each question has three answer options, of which only one is correct or most appropriate. If you feel a correct answer option is not provided, then choose the best fitting option.

Please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others taking this exam.

Comparative Feedback

A lecturer at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) wants to investigate whether comparative feedback about activity within an online learning environment improves study engagement. This feedback consists of information on the amount of time that a student spends on the online platform compared to fellow students (for example: “This week you spent 2.1 hours on the course site, that is more time than 65% of your fellow students.”). To investigate its effectiveness this comparative feedback is compared to general feedback (for example: “This week students spent a total of 216 hours on the course site.”). The feedback is sent via email once a week.

The lecturer investigates the effect of comparative feedback in a group of premaster and regular bachelor students Political Science who follow a Statistics course she teaches. All students are randomly assigned to receive either comparative or general feedback. Students are not told that the feedback is part of a research study, they are only informed that two new methods to report study activity are being tested and that they can expect weekly updates.

The effect of comparative feedback versus general feedback on study engagement is determined using a study engagement questionnaire (engagement, range 10 – 50, interval level) constructed by the lecturer and used for the first time. This questionnaire is administered a week after the end of the course. The questionnaire also inquires about the students' age (in years), sex (male/female) en highest educational degree (secondary education diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree). Finally, the scores on the Statistics exam are collected.

(Correct)

10.
Q.: If the lecturer does not document the study in enough detail, then this compromizes
A.: transparency

11.

A.: a rationalist
A.: an idealist
A.: both
(Correct)

12.
Q.: Suppose the expected effect occurs only for premaster students. The lecturer reports the result of this group of participants alone. We call this
A.: cherry picking
(Correct)

13.

A.: Quine
(Correct)

23.
Q.: The choice to measure engagement with a questionnaire (instead of, for example, by using observation) is associated with the following phase in the empirical cycle
